# [Big-O Cheat Sheet](http://bigocheatsheet.com)

This is a website that has an easily digestible cheat sheet for Big-O notation. I find it interesting because it presents information that I often refer to in a simple and understandable way. Oftentimes when I'm preparing (or cramming) for interviews, I need to quickly look up the Big-O efficiency of doing something, e.g. "Is it more efficient inserting an element in an array or linked list?" Instead of looking at documentation or scrolling through Stack Overflow posts like I do for most computer science/programming-related research, I can just refer to one succinct website. 

I'd recommend that anybody who needs to look up efficiencies of data structures, sorting, searching, etc. use Big-O Cheat Sheet. It's a great resource. To get a quick answer with no explanation, it is the best. However, for information about why something is as efficient as it is, it's best to use some other resource online. Or, a textbook!
